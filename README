Ruby String Extensions To Add Title Case Support
================================================

A set of methods added onto the String class to allow easy title casing of strings.

This extension is available as a gem via GitHub:

    $ sudo gem install samsouder-titlecase --source=http://gems.github.com

Usage (Ruby code):

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'titlecase'
    
    puts "this is a test".titlecase

Usage (Command line):

    $ titlecase "this is a test"

Derived from the rules set by John Gruber at <http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case>. I also derived my test cases from his set. If you find any edge cases, please feel free to add them to the examples.yaml file.

Rules from John Gruber:
-----------------------
  - capitalize each word
  - downcase each of the small_words
  - words with capitals after the first character are left alone
  - words with periods are left alone
  - first and last word always capitalized
  - small words after colons are capitalized
